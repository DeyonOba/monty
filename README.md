## The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## What does LIFO and FIFO mean?
### LIFO (Last In, First Out):
This is a data structure principle where the element added most recently (i.e Last) is the one that is removed first. This principle is similar to stacking of plates, what approach would you use to safely add and remove plates?.
### FIFO (First In, First Out)
This is also a data structure principle where the element that has been in the structure the longest is the first to be removed. In an unjust world with exception of the elderly, nursing mothers, or disabled, what approach would you use to call on people on a queue?.

In this project we created a stack and queue structure, with stacks working on the **LIFO** principle, and queue using the **FIFO** principle.

A stack typicall supports two main operations:
- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.

In a queue the **pop** removes elements from the bottom of the stack.
