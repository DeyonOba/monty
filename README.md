## The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## What does LIFO and FIFO mean?
### LIFO (Last In, First Out):
This is a data structure principle where the element added most recently (i.e Last) is the one that is removed first. This principle is similar to stacking of plates, what approach would you use to add and remove plates.
